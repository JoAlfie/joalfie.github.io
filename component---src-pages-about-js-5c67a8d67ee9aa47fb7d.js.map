I am\n\t\t\t\tenthusiastic and creative with a keen attention to detail, and I enjoy\n\t\t\t\tsharing this with other people.Â I enjoy a challenge and a working\n\t\t\t\texperience which has something different every day, particularly with a\n\t\t\t\tstrong team of colleagues which I can contribute to.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</Layout>\n)\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
