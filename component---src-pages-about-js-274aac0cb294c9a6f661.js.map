I love\n\t\t\t\tlearning new things, building cool stuff, and playing with swords.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tI studied Graphic Communication at the University of South Wales before\n\t\t\t\tmoving into web development. In the past two years I have massively\n\t\t\t\texpanded my skillset from HTML/CSS/JQuery to now include CSS\n\t\t\t\tPreprocessing (Less/Sass), workflow tools (Gulp), version control (Git),\n\t\t\t\tvanilla javascript (inlcuding ES6), modern tools and frameworks such as\n\t\t\t\tReact and Node.js, and mobile app development using React Native.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tThough I have studied and worked in various fields over the past five\n\t\t\t\tyears, my consistent goal throughout has been to put in as much as I can\n\t\t\t\tto every experience and take every opportunity to learn. I am\n\t\t\t\tenthusiastic and creative with a keen attention to detail, and I enjoy\n\t\t\t\tsharing this with other people.Â I enjoy a challenge and a working\n\t\t\t\texperience which has something different every day, particularly with a\n\t\t\t\tstrong team of colleagues which I can contribute to.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tWhen I'm not at a computer I train and teach Historical European Martial\n\t\t\t\tArts at Edel Fencing Academy. I also compete from time to time, and have\n\t\t\t\twon medals in Longsword and Sword & Buckler.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tEmail me:{\" \"}\n\t\t\t\t<Link to={\"mailto:jowimborne@gmail.com\"}>jowimborne@gmail.com</Link>\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</Layout>\n)\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
