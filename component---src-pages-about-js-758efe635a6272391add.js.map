I love\n\t\t\t\tlearning new things, building cool stuff, and playing with swords.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tI studied Graphic Communication at the University of South Wales before\n\t\t\t\tmoving into web development. In the past two years I have massively\n\t\t\t\texpanded my skillset from HTML/CSS/JQuery to now include CSS\n\t\t\t\tPreprocessing (Less/Sass), workflow tools (Gulp), version control (Git),\n\t\t\t\tvanilla javascript (inlcuding ES6), modern tools and frameworks such as\n\t\t\t\tReact and Node.js, and mobile app development using React Native. I am\n\t\t\t\talso proficent in using much of the Adobe suite, including Illustrator,\n\t\t\t\tPhotoshop and InDesign.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tThough I have studied and worked in various fields over the past five\n\t\t\t\tyears, my consistent goal throughout has been to put in as much as I can\n\t\t\t\tto every experience and take every opportunity to learn. I am\n\t\t\t\tenthusiastic and creative with a keen attention to detail, and I enjoy\n\t\t\t\tsharing this with other people.Â I enjoy a challenge and a working\n\t\t\t\texperience which has something different every day, particularly with a\n\t\t\t\tstrong team of colleagues which I can contribute to.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tWhen I'm not at a computer I train and teach Historical European Martial\n\t\t\t\tArts at Edel Fencing Academy. I also compete from time to time, and have\n\t\t\t\twon medals in Longsword and Sword & Buckler.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<h2>Skills</h2>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>HTML</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>CSS (including Less/Sass)</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Javascript (Vanilla/ES6+ and JQuery)</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Responsive websites</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Web accessibility</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Git</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Gulp</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Templating: XLST, Pug</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>CMSs: Symphony CMS, Prismic.io, Wordpress</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>React Native</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>React</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Basics of Node.js and Express</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Basic PHP</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Adobe suite, including Illustrator, Photoshop & InDesign</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Research & Googling</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t<h2>Notable Achievements / Awards</h2>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tGot to grips with React Native in a very short space of time and have\n\t\t\t\t\tsince deployed three mobile apps (BVD Biosecurity Checklist, BAPS App\n\t\t\t\t\tWales, Velindre Mindfulness App) and am in progress with a fourth.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Link to=\"https://www.ycn.org/news/2049-drumroll-commendations\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYCN Awards 2016/7 Commendation\n\t\t\t\t\t</Link>\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tWas instrumental in the growth and ultimate relaunch of Edel Fencing\n\t\t\t\t\tAcademy\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tFour medals from HEMA tournaments: silver in Women's Sword & Buckler\n\t\t\t\t\t(Albion Cup 2019), bronze in Women's Longsword (Wessex League Exeter\n\t\t\t\t\t2019, Exeter Longsword Open 2019, Wessex League London 2017)\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tTaught two longsword workshops at the May Melee 2019, and have been\n\t\t\t\t\tinvited to teach at By The Sword 2020 (the world's biggest HEMA event\n\t\t\t\t\tfor women and gender minorities)\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>RYA Sailing level 2</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tGuinness World Record for the World's Largest Scavenger Hunt (2013)\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t<h2>Like what you've read?</h2>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tEmail me:{\" \"}\n\t\t\t\t<Link to={\"mailto:jowimborne@gmail.com\"}>jowimborne@gmail.com</Link>\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t<a href={data.file.publicURL}>Get my CV</a>\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</Layout>\n)\n\nexport const query = graphql`\n\tquery {\n\t\tfile(relativePath: { eq: \"JoAlfieWimbornecv2019.pdf\" }) {\n\t\t\tpublicURL\n\t\t}\n\t}\n`\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
